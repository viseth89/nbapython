    <h1>Hey Guys!!!</h1>
    <h2>Wanted to give some updates and give myself a checklist</h2>
    <b>Now playing around with the directories and understandin the structure a bit more</b>
    <p>as it turns out, I had it working for most of the time, I just didn't really understand what was going on, so I don't mind too much learning it the hard way, its how I hope I'll remember, anyway will post more later</p>

    <p>Also I have been deleting files and using pretty much terminal for everyting, but to add this index file I used Filezilla, will learn a bit more about terminal althought I think a GUI is very useful to transfer files</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Always use the most recent guides, I had so much difficulty because I was using a outdated guide</li>
      <li>This was further exacerbated by trying to install python3</li>
      <li>I kept trying to make everything in python3, using 2 simplified it quite a bit, plus I figured out how to delete python2 and have it redirect to python3 but I haven't yet tried do everything in python3, maybe for experience and to learn a bit more</li>
      <li>Darn pip, and pip3, installing sometimes to python2 sometimes to python3, learned the hardway smh</li>
      <li>This site is done using apache</li>
      <li>Plan to use this tutorial on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-uwsgi-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04">uWSGI and Nginx servers</a> next </li>
      <li>Then this tutorial on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-16-04">Gunicorn and Nginx servers</a> next </li>
      <li>Play around with the structure a bit more so I fully understand how to link it</li>
      <li>I will be putting up jpg images of my python charts</li>
      <li>This is to help me figure out how to lay everything</li>
      <li>Will look at my old <a href="http://visethsen.github.io/CodeAcademy/">portfolio</a> to wireframe </li>
      <li>Use javascript to display the charts</li>
    </ol>
